    <h1>The Empty Form</h1>
    <div style="display: grid;">
        <iframe src="task1_1.html" height="700" width="600" style="border: 1px solid black";></iframe>
        <p style="width: 600px;">This is the empty form with no tasks. You can enter tasks into the boxes by
            clicking them and typing. When you click the purple checkbox with a plus or press enter 
            the task will be loaded. When you finish writing a task the checkbox will change so that it is a white empty
            box.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1> A form with tasks and some completion </h1>
    <div style="display: grid;">
        <iframe src="task3_2.html" height="700" width="600" style="border: 1px solid black";></iframe>
        <p style="width: 600px;">When you complete a task you can click on the blank checkbox and a checkmark will
            appear to signify that the task is done. Notice that the "add new task" box has moved down with each task that has been added.
            And the plus checkbox remains.
        </p>

    <h1> After pressing one of the bottom buttons </h1>
    <div style="display: grid;">
        <iframe src="task5_3.html" height="700" width="600" style="border: 1px solid black";></iframe>
        <p style="width: 600px;">When you click the "Show Only Uncomplete" button, the page will be rendered so that only the 
            uncomplete items  (the items whose checkboxes haven't been marked) are shown.
            To prevent awkward white space, we made it so that the completed items are switched to 
            "display: none;" However, if you delete all completed items (by clicking the button on the bottom right),
            the completed items will be entirely removed from the html.
