<h1> Our Major Design Decisions </h1>

<p>At first it seemed like the best and most obvious alignment would be to center all the items. We originally wanted the heading and all the tasks to be centered.

<p>But after Prof Millburn's lecture, we decided that a left-align would look more natural. She mentioned that a user's eyes go immediately to the top left corner of any page, 
so that's where the heaviest part of our to-do list lives. However, we then felt as though the page was a little *too* top heavy so we wanted to make the "Show Uncompleted" and "Delete All Completed" buttons at the bottom page a little bigger so that our page felt more full. </p>

<p> Figuring out how we wanted to the checkboxes to look was difficult. Even though the task sounds simple, getting the satisfying square-like box with the green check icon wasn't so easy. We were thinking of also adding "x"-shaped icons next to each of the tasks. Hopefully as user could easily identify the icons as a signifier for deleting individual tasks. The concurrent version of our to-do list looked like the image below:</p>

<p> We did a little bit of user testing. Daniela's mom was our most reliable user. We sent her many drafts and she responded with her thoughts almost immediately every time. Next lab we will probably rely on more friends for user testing. We think this will make it easier to decide on design problems that the two of us might disagree on. For instance, she helped us a little with the color scheme of the title and whether or not we should have text effects (e.g. shadows and glows).

<p> We're proud of the icon and how satisfying the hover function looks on the bottom buttons. The right icon was a little bit difficult to find and once we found it and made it fit with the rest of the page, we were pretty excited. And for a while, something felt wrong about the buttons because they were a similar hue to the rest of the page but just felt weird. Then we inverted the background button color and the button font color and made it so that when you hover over a button the colors invert again to a very nice dark blue background and a white text. We think the bottom buttons look quite nice.</p>
